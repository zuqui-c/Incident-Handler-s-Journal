# Ransomware Incident Response: Healthcare Clinic Case Study

## Overview
This repository documents a simulated incident response journal for a ransomware attack that occurred at a small U.S. healthcare clinic. The incident involved a phishing campaign leading to ransomware deployment, encryption of critical files, and a demand for ransom payment.

## Scenario Summary
On Tuesday morning, July 23, 2024, around 9:00 a.m., several employees at the clinic reported being unable to access their files and systems. A ransom note appeared on their computers, revealing that an organized group of unethical hackers had encrypted the company‚Äôs files. The attackers demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.

The attackers gained access to the system via targeted phishing emails that included malicious attachments. When the attachments were opened, malware was installed, granting the attackers access to deploy the ransomware.
